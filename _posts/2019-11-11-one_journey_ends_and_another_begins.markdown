Yesterday was a surreal bittersweet moment.  Yesterday, I handed in my final project for the Software Engineering Bootcamp course here at Flatiron School.  My journey with learning coding with Flatiron has come to a close, *yet* this is just the beginning.  I am so thankful for what Iâ€™ve learned at Flatiron School.  I feel it has given me such a solid base of marketable skills and understanding that will springboard me into many years to come of continual learning and growth as a software engineer.  

It is nostalgic to look back through the curriculum now.  So many memories pass through my mind as I look at the module headers â€” Ruby, SQL, Active Record, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, and React.  It is funny how during some of those modules, at times, there was so much frustration and doubt, but now I can look back on them with a smile and with a sense of accomplishment.  I made it through.  I can build web apps now â€” that is so awesome and exciting!   

My experience at Flatiron School has reinforced that with hard work and a mindset to grow from failures (instead of wallowing in them), you will overcome.  Donâ€™t give up.  Remember, failure is not a judgment on who you are as a person, it is an opportunity for you to grow as a person and learn.  I am so thankful for the instruction I have received, and I am so hopeful for the new journey that is before me.  I wonder about the types of app Iâ€™ll make and the others that Iâ€™ll have the privilege to be a part of helping to grow.  

So if you are thinking about going into software engineering, give it a shot!  Try out some of Flatiron School's free courses to get a taste of what it could be like (then possibly consider doing a bootcamp with Flatiron ðŸ˜‰).  I wish you well on your journey into becoming a growing coder!
