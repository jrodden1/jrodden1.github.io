<p>Growing up on a farm taught me how to work hard.  It takes time, cultivation, and hard work to grow a crop.  The same concept applies with learning.  I decided to start growing into a developer in 2018 and love it.  I hope this blog will plant some new ideas in you about coding and help you in your growing journey</p>
